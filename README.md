# Matlab-Numerical-Recipes

Welcome to the Matlab-Numerical-Recipes repository! This collection showcases my journey through the fascinating world of numerical analysis and mathematical computation. As a passionate learner, I've implemented various numerical methods in Matlab to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience. This repository is a reflection of my learning process, illustrating the application of numerical recipes in a high-level programming language for ease of understanding and experimentation.

## Highlights of This Repository
This repository contains implementations of a variety of numerical recipes, demonstrating my practical skills in applying complex mathematical concepts. Each implementation was part of my broader learning experience, aimed at consolidating my theoretical knowledge through practical application.

### Barycentric-Lagrange Interpolation
- **Barycentric-Lagrange Interpolation**: Implements the barycentric formulation for Lagrange polynomial interpolation.

### Gauss-Legendre 2D Integration
- **Gauss-Legendre 2D Integration**: Offers an implementation of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature for numerical integration over two-dimensional regions.

### Matrix Inverse Power Using Gauss-Seidl
- **Matrix Inverse to the Power of K Using Gauss-Seidl**: Showcases the iterative solution to computing powers of matrix inverses.

### Adaptive Romberg Integration
- **Adaptive Romberg Integration**: Features an adaptive strategy for Romberg integration.

### ODE Solver Using Adams-Bashforth-Moulton Method
- **ODE Solver (Adams-Bashforth-Moulton-Heun Predictor-Corrector Method)**: Presents an implementation of the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton-Heun Predictor-Corrector method for solving ordinary differential equations of any order, illustrating the technique's efficiency (but not necessairly accuracy since it integrates based on points outside of the integration interval) in numerical solutions.
